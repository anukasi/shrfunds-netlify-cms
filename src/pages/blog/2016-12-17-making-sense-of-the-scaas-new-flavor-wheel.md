### Points to consider:

- Spotify is yet to make a profit. 
- During February 2020, the stock traded for 365$ and it was clearly overvalued at that time. And now it trades for 245$. So it is in the oversold criteria now.
- The global music streaming industry is forecaste to grow at 16% CAGR until 2023.
### Competitors:

- Some of the big competitors in the industry for Spotify are Apple, Google and Amazon Music.        
        
- Spotify has an edge over it's competitors by having huge market share. But it's competitors are serious threats because they can afford to run at a loss. 

- One important point to consider  from Q12020 and Q1 2021 are Spotify continues being the market leader in subscribers growth. Though it's a good news , Google music's subscriber growth has also rapidly increased.

- To continue being the market leader, Spotify needs to find ways to produce profit.
